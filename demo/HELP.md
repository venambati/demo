**Problem:**
Given a string _s_, find the longest palindromic substring in _s_. You may assume that the maximum length of _s_ is 1000.

**Solution:**
Write a Spring Boot micro-service that completes the following:

1. Receives string input over an API
2. Stores the longest palindrome in provided database
3. Retrieves the stored palindrome over an API

You should be able to run your micro-service locally and use an API client (such as PostMan) to test your results.
